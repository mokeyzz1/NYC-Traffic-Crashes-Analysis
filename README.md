# 🚗 NYC Traffic Crashes Analysis 🚦

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes motor vehicle crashes in **New York City**, using **geospatial analysis, time series forecasting, and machine learning techniques** to identify high-risk zones and trends over time.  

🚦 **Key Research Questions:**  
- What are the peak hours for traffic crashes in high-risk areas?  
- How do contributing crash factors vary by borough?  
- How does traffic volume correlate with crash rates?
