# 🚗 NYC Traffic Crashes Analysis 🚦

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores **NYC motor vehicle crashes** using **time series analysis, geospatial visualization, and machine learning techniques** to identify high-risk areas and peak accident times.

## 🔍 Key Findings
- **Peak Crash Hours**: 3 PM - 6 PM rush hours see the most incidents.
- **Most Common Causes**: Driver inattention & failure to yield.
- **Borough Trends**: Brooklyn & Queens have the highest crash rates.
- **Geospatial Insights**: Dangerous intersections identified via heatmaps.

## 📊 Technologies Used
- **Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, folium, statsmodels)**
- **Geospatial Analysis (Folium, NYC OpenData)**
- **Time Series Forecasting (ARIMA, Moving Averages)**
